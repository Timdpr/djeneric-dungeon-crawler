#### Congratulations, you have stumbled upon Tim Russell's fabulous Djeneric Dungeon Crawler game!
It's like nothing you ever saw before!<br/>

## Can I play it?

Sure, make with the cloning and all that. I'll eventually get round to wrapping it in an executable...it's alright but it really needs a bit more gameifying...gamification...needs to be a bit more entertaining before it is 'let loose' on the 'general public' (population: ~0). Originally a purely text-based game, it's now a kind of GUI hybrid. Released here mostly as a learning tool, since I've attempted to follow good practices. Have a couple of [UML](https://i.imgur.com/SvZMCXH.jpg) [diagrams](https://i.imgur.com/8nREQea.jpg), on me.
